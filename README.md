Heelo, I wasnt sure how to do this assignment.  I think it was to delete any item that had exclude in the name.  I first found any emails with the "exclude" in them and then i split it out of the origianl list.  I know how to print the emials out from the re just wasnt sure if this was the correct way of going about it. Your feed back and suggestions are much apprieciated.  You can email me at briantieszen4@gmail.com or leave comment in answer.  Thank you and have a great day
